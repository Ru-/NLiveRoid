/**
 * Handles or intercepts an upstream {@link ChannelEvent}, and sends a
 * {@link ChannelEvent} to the next handler in a {@link ChannelPipeline}.
 * <p>
 * The most common use case of this interface is to intercept an I/O event
 * generated by I/O workers to transform the received messages or execute
 * the relevant business logic.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Firing an event to the next handler</h3>
 * <p>
 * You can forward the received event upstream or downstream.  In most cases,
 * {@link ChannelUpstreamHandler} will send the event upstream (i.e. inbound)
 * although it is legal to send the event downstream (i.e. outbound):
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Sending the event upstream (inbound)
 * void handleUpstream({@link ChannelHandlerContext} ctx, {@link ChannelEvent} e) throws Exception {
 *     ...
 *     ctx.sendUpstream(e);
 *     ...
 * }
 *
 * // Sending the event downstream (outbound)
 * void handleDownstream({@link ChannelHandlerContext} ctx, {@link ChannelEvent} e) throws Exception {
 *     ...
 *     ctx.sendDownstream(new {@link DownstreamMessageEvent}(...));
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h4>Using the helper class to send an event</h4>
 * <p>
 * You will also find various helper methods in {@link Channels} to be useful
 * to generate and send an artificial or manipulated event.
 *
 * <h3>State management</h3>
 *
 * Please refer to {@link ChannelHandler}.
 *
 * <h3>Thread safety</h3>
 * <p>
 * {@link #handleUpstream(ChannelHandlerContext, ChannelEvent) handleUpstream}
 * will be invoked sequentially by the same thread (i.e. an I/O thread) and
 * therefore a handler does not need to worry about being invoked with a new
 * upstream event before the previous upstream event is finished.
 * <p>
 * This does not necessarily mean that there's a dedicated thread per
 * {@link Channel}; the I/O thread of some transport can serve more than one
 * {@link Channel} (e.g. NIO transport), while the I/O thread of other
 * transports can serve only one (e.g. OIO transport).
 * <p>
 * However, if you add an {@link ExecutionHandler} to a {@link ChannelPipeline},
 * this behavior changes depending on what {@link Executor} was employed to
 * dispatch the events.  Please refer to {@link ExecutionHandler} for more
 * information.
